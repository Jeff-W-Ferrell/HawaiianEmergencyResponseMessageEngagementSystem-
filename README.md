# HawaiianEmergencyResponseMessageEngagementSystem-
H.E.R.M.E.S. is a web based UI app made with HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript, created to improve the checks and balances required prior to sending an island-wide "Missile Alert" text to Hawaiians.

*Note that this does not actually send an alert to anybody but the user!
